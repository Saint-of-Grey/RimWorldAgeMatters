		This is a "Balanaced" version of Age Matters for starting with pawns at Age 0. Your pawns will be fully grown at 3.
		
		This is a port of the mod Age Matters to B19 from B18 authored SuavisLupus, Mage5000
			
		This mod is XML Only and should work on Any Version that supports PatchOperations, only tested on b19
		
		How Does this work?
			Cheakily, causes "Youth" disease, as HeDiff_WithSeverity with starts at 1.0 then degrades by a fraction per day 
			to be gone at age 3. on a new Human BodyPart "Maturity". This should be a forever fix.
		
		How does b18 Version work? 
			Gives that disease to anything with a left hand. LeftHands dont exist as a custom body part in B19.
